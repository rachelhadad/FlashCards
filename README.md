User-friendly program to learn vocabulary. A word appears on the screen and the user has a certain amount of time to guess it before the card flips to reveal the answer. 

This program is great in that the vocabulary can easily be exchanged for any language or even just for definitions.

The user indicates whether he/she/they have learned the word by clicking the checkmark or if they have not by clicking the X button. In the case of the latter, a new list is created with just the words still needed to learn so that the user can focus on those words, specifically.
